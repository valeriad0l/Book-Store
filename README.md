# Book Store Project (Web-Based Enterprise Application Design A1) ðŸ“š

## Description
The assignment requires implementing the same website using three different technologies: **Servlet**, **JSP**, and **Node.js**. The bookstore allows users to browse hardcoded books, add them to a shopping cart, update the quantity, and remove items from the cart. A checkout page confirms the cartâ€™s contents and completes the order.

## Features
The main features of the online book store include:
- Display a list of available books.
- Add books to the shopping cart.
- View and update quantities in the cart.
- Remove books from the cart.
- Proceed to checkout.
